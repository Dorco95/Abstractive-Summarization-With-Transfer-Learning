Abstractive summarization using bert as encoder and transformer decoder

I have used a text generation library called Texar , Its a beautiful library with a lot of abstractions, i would say it to be 
scikit learn for text generation problems.

I have replaced the Encoder part in Transformer networks with BERT Encoder and the kept the decoder as it is .
