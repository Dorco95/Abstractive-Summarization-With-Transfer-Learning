<h3>Abstractive summarization using bert as encoder and transformer decoder</h3>

I have used a text generation library called Texar , Its a beautiful library with a lot of abstractions, i would say it to be 
scikit learn for text generation problems.

The main idea behind this architecture is to use the transfer learning from pretrained BERT a masked language model ,
I have replaced the Encoder part with BERT Encoder and the deocder is trained from the scratch.

One of the advantages of using Transfomer Networks is training is much faster than LSTM based models as elimanate sequential behaviour in Transformer models.

Transformer based models generate more gramatically correct  coherent sentences.
